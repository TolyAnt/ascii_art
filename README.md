ASCII Art Generator
This script converts images to ASCII art using Python. It fetches an image from a URL, resizes it, and generates an ASCII art version of the image which is then saved as an HTML file.

Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You will also need to install the following packages:

requests
Pillow
ascii_magic
You can install them using pip:

pip install requests Pillow ascii_magic

Usage
Download the Script: Clone this repository or download the script to your local machine.
Run the Script: Open your command line interface (CLI), navigate to the directory where the script is saved, and run the script with:


python ascii_art_generator.py

View the Result: After running the script, an HTML file named ascii_art.html will be created in the same directory. Open this file in any web browser to view the generated ASCII art.
How It Works
Image Download: The script starts by downloading an image from a predefined URL using the requests library.
Image Processing: It then saves the image and resizes it to a specified width of 200 pixels while maintaining the aspect ratio using the Pillow library.
ASCII Conversion: The resized image is converted to ASCII art using the ascii_magic library.
Output: The ASCII art is saved to an HTML file, making it easy to view in a browser.
Cleanup: Temporary files created during the process are automatically deleted at the end of the script.
Customization
To convert a different image, replace the url variable at the top of the script with the link to your desired image.
